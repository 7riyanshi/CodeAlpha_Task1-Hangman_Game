# CodeAlpha_Task1-Hangman_Game
Developed a console-based Hangman game using Python where the user guesses a hidden word one letter at a time. The program tracks correct and incorrect guesses, limits the number of attempts, and determines win or loss conditions using basic control flow, loops, and data structures.
